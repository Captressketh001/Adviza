# Adviza

An Inspirational app for techies. Developer's get access to inspiring qoutes from Top Tech Leaders and Creator on LinkedIn. Firebase is used to store and retrieve advices. React and TailwindCSS is used for the interface design. I built this side project for the purpose of mastering React after doing Vue.JS for 2 years. The app is fully responsive and can adapt to user's devices.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The Process

I started by building the advice page interface using Vanilla CSS and tailwind css. I created a firebase project, set it up in my react app. I went ahead to create the authentication module and collections for storing the advices. 

The advice collection has three fields: author, content and status. I also implemented a role based authentication using firebase cloud functions.

## üìö What I Learned

During this project, I've being able to master some React concepts and Firebase functions.

###  `useEffect` Hook:

- **Loading data on first time Load**: Using the `useEffect` hook reminded me of the onMounted hook in vue.js.

###  `React Router`:

- **Protecting a route from unathorized access**: I learnt how to protect a route from unauthorized access using prop drilling.

###  Firebase Cloud Function:

- **Role based authentication**: I learnt how to write cloud functions to perform specific functions.

### üé® Using Tailwind CSS:

- **New Tools**: I used Tailwind css extensively for the first time in this project. I've always loved to write vanilla css but I'm blown off with Tailwind CSS features.


### üìà Overall Growth:

Each part of this project challenged me to learn something new things even though I'm not new to development.

## üí≠ How can it be improved?

- Use a backend tools to create APIs instead of Firebase.
- Improve Performance on both desktop and mobile from 87% and 59% to 100% respectively.
- Improve SEO from 85% to 100%.
